admin:
  # Admin wallet address - the only wallet authorized to send admin commands
  wallet_address: "0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef12345678"

  # Maximum age of commands in seconds (default: 300)

  # Destination mode - how to filter transaction destinations
  # Options:
  #   "any"    - Accept commands to any destination (simplest)
  #   "self"   - Admin must send to own address (tx.from === tx.to)
  #   "server" - Admin must send to server's ETH address (derived from pubkey)
